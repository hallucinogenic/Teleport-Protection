# Teleport-Protection

A Simple Teleport Protection, meant to be for <u><b>CS:S and CS:GO servers</b></u>, using the Source Mod Addon;

This plugin just protects you from any damage since you touched a teleport entity (called trigger_teleport).

It doesn't need any specific zones plugin, since it only works with teleports that is caused by touching a trigger_teleport in the map!

This plugin was meant to be private (just for my community), but some m*********** decided to share it with everyone (because I gave to a friend and he decided to configure), so it's totally my fault.
But the problem is that he tried to sell many times, so I decided to publish here on github, with some differences.

Changelog since the "leaked" version:

<ul>
<li>Added Translations, to be easy to configure to server owners.</li>
<li>Added colors to the translations, if you want a colorfull text.</li>
<li>Added a CVAR to change the time you want to be fully god mode.</li>
<li>Converted everything to the new Syntax.</li>
</ul>


Installation:
<ol>
<li>Drag the file named <i>telekill_protect.smx</i> to <b>sourcemod/plugins</b>.</li>
<li>Drag the file named <i>sm_telekill_protection.phrases.txt</i> to <b>sourcemod/translations</b>.</li>
<li>Load the plugin or just wait for the next map.</li>
</ol>

For the developers:
